Atmanirbhar, which translates to 'self-reliant' or 'self-sufficient', which is a dream for many of us , "a bigger and more important part of the global economy", pursuing policies that are efficient, competitive and resilient, and being self-sustaining and self-generating . 

As the name suggest ATMA-NIRBHAR , our app(project) basically focuses on providing employment as well as working-opportunities to the people living in rural areas so that they can earn respect in society and earn for their living and also lead to women empowerment . Women's empowerment is the process of empowering women. Empowerment can be defined in many ways, however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the decision-making process into it. Womenâ€™s empowerment is the most crucial point to be noted for the overall development of a country.  This would also increase the gdp of our country as well as the number of tax-payers in the country and will reduce percentage of crime-rate . This project is all about providing employment to the people living in rural areas and can do labour work including working in shops , household chores , factory work and many more.......

This would also help the people to  get low wage workers who can help them to get their work done and thus can use human labour in an effective way and get most out of them and this would benefit them . 

LET'S RACE AHEAD AND BEGIN OUR JOURNEY OF BEING ATMA-NIRBHAR.
